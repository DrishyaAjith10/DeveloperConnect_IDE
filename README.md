# 🚀 Developer Connect  
### Real-Time Collaborative Web IDE

---

## 📌 Project Description

Developer Connect is a browser-based real-time collaborative coding platform built using **React**, **Node.js**, and **Socket.io**.

The platform allows multiple users to join a shared room and collaborate inside a synchronized coding environment. Users can:

- Join a common collaboration room  
- Edit code simultaneously  
- Receive live code updates instantly  
- Communicate through an integrated chat system  

Real-time synchronization is powered by **WebSocket-based communication** using Socket.io, ensuring low-latency, event-driven updates between connected clients.

The core objective of this project is to demonstrate real-time, multi-user collaboration within a web-based IDE environment.
